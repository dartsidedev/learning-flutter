# `dartsidedev/learning-flutter`

Flutter codelabs, cookbooks and other tutorials.

## Recommendations

### Beginners

#### Setup

[Follow the official guide.](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started)

* `flutter` is installed
* your IDE "understands" Dart code
* you can run a Flutter app on a physical device or emulator/simulator

#### Learn

After you've set up your development environment, I find that these are the best codelabs for people with no Flutter or Dart experience.

1. [Intro to Dart for Java Developers](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/from-java-to-dart/index.html) - 20 min
2. [Write Your First Flutter App](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt1/index.html?) ([Part 2.](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt2/index.html)) 43 + 43 minutes
3. [Firebase for Flutter](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-firebase/index.html#0) - 61 min

## Resources

### [Codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/?cat=Flutter)

> Codelabs provide a guided, tutorial, hands-on coding experience. Most codelabs will step you through the process of building a small application, or adding a new feature to an existing application.

### [Cookbook](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

> The cookbook contains recipes that demonstrate how to solve common problems while writing Flutter apps. Each recipe is self-contained and can be used as a reference to help you build up an application.

### YouTube

* [Official Flutter channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwXdFgeE9KYzlDdR7TG9cMw)

#### [Widget of the Week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_sQ9bMltGU&list=PLjxrf2q8roU23XGwz3Km7sQZFTdB996iG)

Short videos (~1 min) introducing a widget and its features and usage.

#### [The Boring Flutter Development Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqPG1tU6-c0&list=PLjxrf2q8roU3ahJVrSgAnPjzkpGmL9Czl)

A list of YouTube videos (each video is around an hour long) where Flutter developers work on an app or task. Almost no editing, so you can see all the mistakes and observe the thought process of the developers.

#### [Fluttery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syd0c9Vi2hg&list=PLkXouNW6n0A8ANZ16Fk49qsxpBbzxHGCn)

Implement beautiful custom user interfaces with Flutter. Videos show all necessary steps to create pretty advanced UIs and are usually ~2-3 hours long.

#### [Flutter in Focus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgTBLj7rMPM&list=PLjxrf2q8roU2HdJQDjJzOeO6J3FoFLWr2)

Best practices explained in 5-10 minutes.

#### [Flutter tutorial for Beginners by Academind/Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZCz6Ylqk3A)

Detailed, very clear (though it's longer than 3 hours, so you won't be able to finish it at the study jam) video tutorial.

    * Authors didn't pay much attention to Navigation details (users can go back to home product listing after they logged out).
