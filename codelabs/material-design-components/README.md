# Material Components for Flutter

This folder contains code from four codelabs (MDC codelabs).

1. Basics: login screen
2. Structure and layout: app bar with icons and a grid list full of products

## [Material Components Basics](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-101-flutter)

We build a login page that contains a logo, product name, username+password fields and two buttons.

### [Introduction](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-101-flutter/#0)

*Material Design* is a system for building digital products. It unites style, branding, interaction and motion under a consistent set of principles and components.

*Material Design for Flutter* unite design and engineering with a library of components that create a consistent user experience across apps and platforms.

In this codelab, we learn how to customize components to reflect any brand or style.

### [Add TextField widgets](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-101-flutter/#3)

We'll use the `TextField` widget, which displays a floating label and activates a touch ripple.

Make a `TextField` filled to help people recognize the tap or touch target area of the text field.

### [Add buttons](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-101-flutter/#4)

A layout should contain a single prominent button: use `RaisedButton`.

## [Material Structure and Layout](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-102-flutter)

In this codelab, we add an app bar with icons and a grid with products.

### [Add a card in a grid](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-102-flutter/#4)

Exactly one card :)
